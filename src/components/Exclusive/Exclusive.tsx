          In 2079; the earthâ€™s resources has been depleted to their last
          reserves. This almost created the end of humanity on earth. 10 years
          later, only 4 areas of the world were viable to live in. In these
          areas were 4 regions, the inhabitants of each of these regions had
          developed powers. Over time, conflicts over resources began to emerge.
